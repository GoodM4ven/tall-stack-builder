# TALL Stack Builder

Helps the [TALL Stack DevContainer](https://github.com/GoodM4ven/tall-stack) preset to be versioned and customized.

> **Warning**: The customization feature is still under development.

### Description

This is an **internal** package that manages my [TALL Stack preset](https://github.com/GoodM4ven/tall-stack)'s versioning and provides CI to customize the stack with few more packages upon installation.

The purpose is to have those popular packages installed along with extreme ease!


## Development
